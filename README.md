# Quiz Battle

Real-time multiplayer quiz game built with a **microservices architecture** — 5 Go backend services (3 gRPC + 1 HTTP + 1 worker), Flutter frontend, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Firebase Cloud Messaging.

Players register (email/password or Google), get matched with opponents, compete across timed rounds with difficulty-based scoring and speed bonuses, climb persistent leaderboards, earn daily rewards, refer friends, purchase premium via Razorpay, and receive FCM push notifications.

                          |           |           |
                       MongoDB      Redis     RabbitMQ
```

### Service Responsibilities

| Service | Port | Responsibilities |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Matchmaking** | :50051 / :8080 | User registration/login (JWT), Google OAuth, matchmaking pool, room creation, referral system, device token registration |
| **Quiz Engine** | :50052 | Consumes `match.created` (selects questions), runs game loop, streams events to clients, late-joiner catch-up |
| **Scoring** | :50053 | Consumes `answer.submitted` (validates + scores), updates Redis leaderboard, server-side leaderboard cap for free users |
| **Payment** | :8081 | Razorpay order creation, HMAC verification, subscription activation, coupon validation, publishes `payment.success` to RabbitMQ |
| **Notification Worker** | — | FCM push notifications, RabbitMQ consumers (referral conversion), cron scheduler (streak/daily/premium expiry) |

### Inter-Service Communication

| From | To | Mechanism | Event |
|------|----|-----------|-------|
| Matchmaking | Quiz Engine | RabbitMQ | `match.created` (triggers question selection) |
| Quiz Engine | Scoring | RabbitMQ | `answer.submitted` (triggers scoring) |
| Quiz Engine | (any) | RabbitMQ | `round.completed`, `match.finished` |
| Flutter | Matchmaking | gRPC :50051 | Register, Login, GoogleAuth, JoinMatchmaking, SubscribeToMatch |
| Flutter | Quiz Engine | gRPC :50052 | StreamGameEvents, SubmitAnswer |
| Flutter | Scoring | gRPC :50053 | GetLeaderboard |
| Flutter | Payment | HTTP :8081 | CreateOrder, VerifyPayment, GetStatus, ValidateCoupon |
| Payment | (any) | RabbitMQ | `payment.success` (post-capture event) |
| Quiz Engine | Notification Worker | RabbitMQ | `match.finished` (triggers referral conversion notification) |
| (cron/event) | Notification Worker | RabbitMQ | `notification.*` (streak, daily reward, tournament, premium expiry) |
| Notification Worker | Devices | FCM | Push notifications to Android/iOS devices |

## Prerequisites

```bash
# macOS
brew install go protobuf redis

# Flutter SDK — https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

# Protobuf plugins
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
dart pub global activate protoc_plugin

# Docker — https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

# Xcode + iOS Simulators
xcode-select --install
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
make infra
# Starts MongoDB (:27017), Redis (:6379), RabbitMQ (:5672 / UI :15672)
```

### 2. Start all backend services (separate terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1
make run-matchmaking

# Terminal 2
make run-quiz

# Terminal 3
make run-scoring

# Terminal 4 (optional — only needed for Razorpay / premium features)
cd payment-service && go run main.go
```

You should see:
```
✅ Redis connected       ✅ RabbitMQ connected       ✅ MongoDB connected
🚀 Matchmaking gRPC server listening on :50051
🚀 Quiz gRPC server listening on :50052
🚀 Scoring gRPC server listening on :50053
🚀 Payment HTTP server listening on :8081
```

### 3. Or run everything containerized

```bash
make up
# Builds and starts all services + infra via Docker Compose
```

### 4. Seed data

```bash
make seed          # 60 questions into MongoDB
make seed-users    # 6 test users (alice/bob/charlie/diana/evan/fiona, password: speakx123)
```

### 5. Start iOS simulators

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices booted
# Copy device IDs

# Terminal A
cd flutter-app && flutter run -d <DEVICE_ID_1>

# Terminal B
cd flutter-app && flutter run -d <DEVICE_ID_2>
```

### 6. Play!

1. Register or use a test account on each simulator
2. Tap **Play Now** on both devices
3. Wait ~10 seconds for the match lobby
4. Answer questions — faster correct answers earn more points!

```bash
make proto             # Regenerate Go + Dart protobuf files
make infra             # Start MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ (Docker)
make up                # Build + start everything (Docker Compose)

make run-scoring       # Run scoring-service locally
make test              # Run all Go tests
make test-flutter      # Run Flutter unit tests (31 tests)
make seed              # Re-seed MongoDB questions
make seed-users        # Seed 6 test users
make kill              # Kill processes on ports 50051-50053, 8080, 8081
make clean             # Flutter clean + Docker volume cleanup
```

## Authentication

Two login methods are supported:

### Email / Password
- Register via `POST` gRPC `Register` → bcrypt hash stored in MongoDB
- Login via gRPC `Login` → JWT (HS256, 24h) returned
- Credentials saved in SharedPreferences for silent session restore

### Google Sign-In
- Flutter opens Google consent screen via `google_sign_in` SDK
- ID token exchanged at `POST http://localhost:8080/auth/google`
- Backend verifies token with Google, upserts user in MongoDB, returns JWT
- Profile picture URL stored and shown across all screens (CachedNetworkImage)
- Silent re-authentication on app restart via `signInSilently()`

Every gRPC call carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>` metadata. Interceptors validate the token and inject `userId` into context — handlers never trust the request body for identity.

## Game Flow

```
Register / Login (email or Google)
    |
Home Screen — daily quota + streak + Play Now button
    |
Matchmaking Lobby (waiting for 4 players)
    |                                           match.created
Matchmaking Service ──────────────────────────→ RabbitMQ ──→ Quiz Engine
    |                                                         (selects questions)
Match Found → consumeDailyQuiz() called → All clients connect to StreamGameEvents
    |
5 Rounds:
  → Question broadcast (30s timer)
  → Players answer → SubmitAnswer writes to Redis immediately
  → Round advances as soon as all active players answer (or timer expires)
  → answer.submitted → RabbitMQ → Scoring Service (scores + updates leaderboard)
  → RoundResult broadcast (correct answer + fastest correct player + win streak)
  → Between-round leaderboard (5s pause) — shows answer streak + win streak badges
    |
Match End → Results Screen
  → Winner announced, final scores
  → XP = total match score → rating updated in MongoDB
  → Three buttons: Share · Home · Play Again
```

### Forfeit Flow
- Player taps X → sends `answerIndex: -1` → marked inactive
- Player sees spectating screen with live scores
- Remaining players continue; rounds advance based on active count
- If 1 player left → auto-win regardless of score
- All players receive MatchEnd when game finishes

---

## Scoring System

| Difficulty | Base Points | + Speed Bonus (max) | Max Per Round |
|------------|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Easy | 100 | +50 | 150 |
| Medium | 125 | +50 | 175 |
| Hard | 150 | +50 | 200 |

**Speed bonus** = `50 * (1 - responseMs / 10000)` — linear decay over 10 seconds.

**Question distribution** per match: 4 easy + 4 medium + 2 hard = 10 rounds total (configurable).

**Rating** increases by total match score after each game.

---

## Daily Rewards & Login Streak

A complete daily engagement system. All logic is **client-side** (SharedPreferences) — works fully offline.

### How It Works

Every time the user opens the app and logs in for the **first time that calendar day**, their login streak increments by 1. Missing a day resets the streak to 1 on the next login.

### Reward Popup

On first open of the home screen each day, an **animated popup** appears automatically if the user has an unclaimed reward. The user must tap **Claim Reward** to receive it. Tapping **Later** dismisses without claiming (popup reappears next open).

### Reward Table

| Streak Day | Coins | Bonus Games | Badge | Premium Trial |
|------------|-------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | 50 | — | — | — |
| 2 | 75 | — | — | — |
| 3 | 100 | +1 | — | — |
| 4 | 125 | — | — | — |
| 5 | 150 | +2 | — | — |
| 6 | 200 | — | — | — |
| **7** | **250** | **+3** | **Week Warrior** | — |
| **14** *(milestone)* | **500** | **+5** | **Fortnight Fighter** | — |
| **30** *(milestone)* | **1000** | **+7** | **Monthly Master** | **7 days Premium** |

After day 7 the weekly cycle repeats (day 8 = day 1 rewards, etc.). Milestones at 14 and 30 always override the cycle.

### Coins

A soft currency that accumulates permanently (never expires, never decreases). Shown on the Profile → STREAK tab. Used for future cosmetic features.

### Bonus Games

Bonus games stack on top of the free daily 5. For example, day-3 reward grants +1 bonus game → the user gets **6 games that day** (and any remaining bonus games carry over to the next day).

The daily quota card on the home screen shows:
```
3 / 5 games played today  ·  +3 bonus
```

### Premium Trial

The Day-30 milestone grants **7 days of free Premium**. During the trial:
- Unlimited daily games
- Full global leaderboard (not capped at top 3)
- Premium badge displayed

The trial is time-based and checked in real-time via the `isEffectivelyPremium` computed getter — no logout/login cycle needed when it expires.

### Home Screen — Streak Pill

A flame counter appears in the top bar whenever streak > 0:
```
🔥 7
```

### Profile → STREAK Tab (4th tab)

- **Streak Summary** — current streak, all-time best streak
- **Coins Card** — total coins earned + bonus games remaining
- **30-Day Calendar** — 7-column grid; green = logged in, gold border = today, dim = missed day

---

## Premium Subscription (Razorpay)

Free users get **5 games/day**. Premium users get unlimited games.

### Plans

| Plan | Price | Duration |
|------|-------|---------|
| Monthly | ₹499 | 30 days |
| Yearly | ₹3,999 | 365 days |

### Payment Flow

```
1. User taps "Go Premium" → payment-service POST /payment/create-order
2. Razorpay checkout opens in Flutter WebView / SDK
3. On success → POST /payment/verify (HMAC-SHA256 signature check)
4. Verification passes → subscription activated in MongoDB
5. Flutter calls GET /payment/status → isPremium = true
6. Local SharedPreferences updated + state reflects premium immediately
```

**Signature verification (no webhook):**
```
HMAC-SHA256(key_secret, order_id + "|" + payment_id) == razorpay_signature
```

### Premium Sync Across Devices

`AuthNotifier._syncPremiumFromServer()` calls `GET /payment/status` after every login. If the server says `is_active: true` and the local flag says false (or vice versa), the local state is updated. This handles:
- User buys premium on Phone A → logs in on Phone B → premium is active immediately
- Premium expires → next login on any device → plan shown as free

**`isEffectivelyPremium`** — a computed getter that returns `true` for either paid premium OR an active daily-reward premium trial. All quota/upsell checks use this getter, not `isPremium` directly.

### Payment Failure Handling

If Razorpay returns a failure callback:
- The `Future.delayed(Duration.zero, ...)` wrapper on Android prevents the Activity destruction from crashing the Flutter engine
- User sees a friendly error dialog (not a blank screen or crash)
- No quota is consumed on payment failure

### Test UPI ID

```
success@razorpay
```

See [docs/razorpay.md](docs/razorpay.md) for full setup, test credentials, and integration details.

## Win Streak Badge

In `leaderboard_screen.dart` (between-round screen), two streak badges stack:

```
🔥 Answer Streak x4        (shows for ≥2 consecutive correct answers)
⚡ Speed Win Streak x2     (shows for ≥2 rounds won: correct AND fastest)
```

"Winning" a round = correct answer AND `fastestUserId == myUserId` from `RoundResultEvent`.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why 4 Services?

| Service | Why Separate |
|---------|-------------|
| Matchmaking | Owns player identity + room lifecycle; must be available even during a game |
| Quiz Engine | Long-lived streaming connections; game state isolated per room |
| Scoring | High write frequency (every answer); atomic Redis ops independent of game loop |
| Payment | PCI-adjacent; HTTP not gRPC; Razorpay webhook surface isolated |

### Race Condition Prevention

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Concurrent score updates | Lua script: `ZINCRBY + EXPIRE + ZREVRANK` atomic |
| Concurrent room creation | Distributed lock: `SET NX EX` + UUID owner + Lua compare-and-delete |
| Multiple game loop starts | `sync.Once` — first subscriber triggers, others just receive |
| Duplicate answer scoring | `HEXISTS` idempotency check before scoring |
| Matchmaking ZPOPMIN race | Global Redis lock around ZPOPMIN |
| Razorpay Activity crash (Android) | `Future.delayed(Duration.zero, ...)` defers callback past Activity destruction |

### Question Deduplication

`SelectForRoom` in `quiz-service/questions/selection.go` fetches previously-seen `questionIds` from `match_history` for all players in the room, then excludes them. A Fisher-Yates shuffle replaces MongoDB `$sample` (which had a repeat bias at small pool sizes).

### Login Streak vs Match Streak

| Term | When Updated | Storage |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Login streak (`currentStreak`) | On login, via `_updateLoginStreak()` | SharedPreferences `loginHistory` (JSON array) |
| Answer streak (`maxAnswerStreak`) | Per round in `GameNotifier` | `GameState` (in-memory, stored at match end) |
| Win streak (`maxWinStreak`) | Per round in `GameNotifier` | `GameState` (in-memory) |

### `isEffectivelyPremium` vs `isPremium`

`isPremium` = paid Razorpay subscription.
`isEffectivelyPremium` = `isPremium OR (premiumTrialExpiresAt != null AND expiry > now)`.

All quota checks, upsell card visibility, and leaderboard limits use `isEffectivelyPremium`. This ensures the day-30 streak trial unlocks the same features as a paid subscription without any code duplication.

## Redis Key Ownership

| Service | Keys | TTL |
|---------|------|-----|
| Matchmaking | `matchmaking:pool`, `player:{id}`, `room:{id}:state`, `room:{id}:players`, `room:lock:{id}` | 30 min |
| Quiz Engine | `room:{id}:questions`, `room:{id}:submitted:{round}`, `room:{id}:round:{n}:started_at`, `room:{id}:round:{n}:closed` | 30 min |
| Scoring | `room:{id}:leaderboard`, `room:{id}:answers:{round}`, `room:{id}:correct_counts`, `room:{id}:response_sum`, `room:{id}:response_count` | 30 min |
| User/Premium | `user:{id}:plan` → free/premium, `user:{id}:daily_quota` → remaining or "unlimited" | 1 day |
| Referral | `referral:code:{code}` → userId | no TTL |
| Streak | `user:{id}:streak` hash → {current, longest, last_login} | no TTL |

---

## MongoDB Collections

| Collection | Owner | Key Fields |
|------------|-------|------------|
| `users` | Matchmaking | `username` (unique), `password_hash`, `rating`, `google_id` |

| `referrals` | Matchmaking | `referrer_id`, `referee_id` (unique), `code_used`, `created_at` |

---

| Routing Key | Publisher | Consumer | Payload |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| `match.created` | Matchmaking | Quiz Engine | roomId, players[], totalRounds |

---

## Environment Variables

### All Go services

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GRPC_ADDR` | `:5005x` | gRPC listen address |
| `REDIS_ADDR` | `localhost:6379` | Redis address |
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/` | RabbitMQ URL |
| `MONGO_URI` | `mongodb://localhost:27017` | MongoDB URI |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `your-secret-key` | Shared JWT signing secret |

### Payment service

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | Razorpay API key (starts with `rzp_test_`) |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | Razorpay secret for HMAC verification |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Razorpay webhook signing secret |
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | RabbitMQ URL (for payment-success-queue) |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string |

---

## Seed Data

### Questions (`mongo-init/init.js`)
- 60 questions, 3 difficulty levels, 12 topics
- Run: `make seed`

### Test Users (`matchmaking-service/cmd/seed/main.go`)

| Username | Password | Rating |
|----------|----------|--------|
| alice | speakx123 | 1200 |
| bob | speakx123 | 1050 |
| charlie | speakx123 | 1380 |
| diana | speakx123 | 975 |
| evan | speakx123 | 1520 |
| fiona | speakx123 | 890 |

Run: `make seed-users`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Ports in use
```bash
make kill
```

### Redis / RabbitMQ / MongoDB not connecting
```bash
make infra
docker compose ps   # verify all healthy
```

### Matchmaking stuck
```bash
redis-cli DEL matchmaking:pool
```

### Questions repeating
The question pool is de-duplicated per player across matches. If the pool is too small relative to active players, the system falls back to unrestricted selection. Add more questions to `mongo-init/init.js` and run `make seed`.

### Premium not reflecting after payment
The Flutter app syncs premium status at every login via `GET /payment/status`. If the payment service is down, the local cached value is used. Force-sync by logging out and back in.

### Daily reward popup not appearing
The popup only appears if `pendingReward != null` in `AuthState`. Check:
1. `currentStreak > 0` — streak must be at least 1
2. `dailyRewardClaimedDate != today` — not already claimed today
3. `isLoggedIn == true`

### iOS build fails
```bash
cd flutter-app
flutter clean
flutter create . --platforms ios
flutter pub get
```

### Stale data after code changes
```bash
redis-cli FLUSHALL
docker exec quiz_mongodb mongosh quizdb --eval "db.match_history.deleteMany({})"
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Flutter unit tests (31 tests)
cd flutter-app && flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Go tests
make test
```

Flutter tests cover:
- `GameState` defaults and `copyWith`
- Win streak logic (5 cases)
- Daily quota with bonus games (6 cases)
- `isEffectivelyPremium` including trial expiry (5 cases)
- `rewardForDay` reward table (6 cases)
- `pendingReward` edge cases (4 cases)
- `copyWith` sentinel for nullable `premiumTrialExpiresAt` (2 cases)

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

| Limitation | Impact | Future Fix |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Daily quota exhaustion error not shown in matchmaking UI | Player sits in lobby silently when server rejects | Show SnackBar on `ResourceExhausted` gRPC error |
| UPI not visible on Android emulators without Google Pay | Emulator-only; works on real devices | Razorpay SDK limitation — no code fix possible |
| Match winner tiebreaker uses lexicographic userID | Arbitrary when scores are exactly equal | Add tiebreaker: most correct answers → fastest avg response time |
| Coins and bonus games are push-synced (eventual consistency) | Brief window where local > server after claim | Add server-side coin ledger with atomic operations |
| No tournament bracket system | Tournament notifications work but no actual tournament | Build tournament service with bracket/round-robin |
| `clearMatchHistory` in demo mode removes question tracking | Same questions may repeat across matches | Remove `clearMatchHistory` or increase question pool |
| Google Sign-In requires Google Play Services on emulator | Network errors on emulators without Play Store | Use Google API emulator images |
| No password reset / forgot password flow | Users must create a new account | Add email-based password reset |
| Push notifications require Firebase project setup | Won't work without `google-services.json` + service account | Document setup clearly (done in `docs/push-notifications.md`) |
